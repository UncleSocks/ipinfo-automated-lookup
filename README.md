# ipinfo-automated-lookup
A Python script that automates IP address lookup on IPInfo and displays the output in IPADDRESS[COUNTRY:ORGANIZATION] format. The script accepts IP address organization keyword/s and outputs the addresses matching the keyword/s (it is also capable of negating your searches). NOTE: It will require your IPInfo Access Token.
